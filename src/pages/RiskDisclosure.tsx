THE SERVICES, CONTENT, AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SUGARTRADES ARE EDUCATIONAL IN NATURE AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES OR INVESTMENT ADVICE. TRADING AND INVESTING IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT A TRAINED INVESTOR. SUCH ACTIVITIES SHALL BE CONDUCTED AT YOUR OWN RISK.

          <p className="mb-6">
            Trading and investing in cryptocurrencies involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of cryptocurrencies and futures may fluctuate, and, as a result, you may lose more than your original investment. Futures trading is highly leveraged and small market movements can have significant impacts, both positive and negative, on your trading account.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited. You are responsible for all risks and financial resources you use. Do not engage in trading unless you fully understand the risks involved. If you do not, seek advice from a licensed financial advisor.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Cryptocurrencies represent a rapidly evolving and unpredictable market. SugarTrades cannot and does not claim to anticipate all risks. Forward-looking statements made by SugarTrades or its team are not guarantees of future outcomes and are not obligations to update.
